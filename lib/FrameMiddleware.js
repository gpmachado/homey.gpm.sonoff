/**
 * @file FrameMiddleware.js
 * @description A single `node.handleFrame` per Zigbee node, with named handlers run in priority
 * order instead of each layer wrapping the previous one. In use by lib/rejoinDetection.js and
 * lib/availabilityHooks.js; SonoffBase's Basic filter and cluster-report interceptor are not
 * migrated yet (see TODO.md, "Frame hooks").
 *
 * Fixes, versus an earlier sketch of this idea:
 * - The original handler is stored as-is (no `.bind()`), so restoring it puts back the exact
 *   same function reference the node had before, not a new bound copy.
 * - `unregister()` restores `node.handleFrame` itself once the handler list is empty; there is
 *   no separate `dispose()` step to remember to call.
 * - A teardown path uses the static `unregister(node, id)`, which never installs a middleware
 *   on a node that does not already have one - removing something that was never added is a
 *   no-op, not a fresh wrap-then-immediately-restore.
 *
 * What a handler must be: a synchronous function `(endpointId, clusterId, frame, meta) => result`.
 * Async work (a Zigbee read/write, a store write) must be fire-and-forget with its own `.catch()`,
 * the same convention every hook in this app already follows - this middleware's `try/catch`
 * only guards against a handler throwing synchronously, not against a later promise rejection.
 * Return `false` to swallow the frame (stop the chain and skip the original handler and any
 * lower-priority ones); return anything else (including nothing) to let it continue.
 *
 * Handler id and scope: pass a node-level id (the same string regardless of which device
 * instance is installing it) for anything that must exist once per node no matter how many
 * devices share it - a multi-gang node (MINI-ZB2GS) runs `onNodeInit` once per gang. Pass a
 * device-specific id (e.g. including `device.getData().id`) only when the handler's own logic
 * is genuinely per-device. Registering the same node-level concept under different per-device
 * ids installs one duplicate handler per device sharing the node - this module cannot detect
 * that misuse, so the convention has to be followed by the caller.
 *
 * @example
 * const { FrameMiddleware, FRAME_PRIORITY } = require('../lib/FrameMiddleware');
 * const mw = FrameMiddleware.for(this.node);
 * mw.register('rejoin', FRAME_PRIORITY.REJOIN, (endpointId, clusterId, frame) => { ... });
 * // later, in _teardown():
 * FrameMiddleware.unregister(this.node, 'rejoin');

const FRAME_PRIORITY = {
  // The rule: a handler that never returns `false` (an "observer") must have a lower number than
  // any handler that can swallow a frame it needs to see - the dispatch loop stops at the first
  // `false`, so a swallower running earlier hides that frame from every observer after it. Both
  // gaps below were found and confirmed (with a simulated node) while reviewing a proposed
  // migration of SonoffBase onto this module, before anything was actually changed there:
  // - AVAILABILITY behind a swallower: the Traffic tab's message count stops advancing for
  //   whatever gets swallowed (a naive "notify activity on swallow" compensation only restores
  //   the availability timeout, not that count - only AVAILABILITY's own handler seeing the frame
  //   records it).
  // - REJOIN behind a swallower: MINI-ZB1GP's rejoin detection needs to see the exact SonoffCluster
  //   report a migrated cluster-report interceptor would swallow to parse it - behind such a
  //   swallower, the "Reconnected after power cut" trigger would silently stop firing.
  // Both observers sit below 10 so neither problem can resurface no matter what a future
  // swallower's own number is picked as, as long as it stays a swallower (BASIC_FILTER,
  // CLUSTER_REPORT and anything added later).
  AVAILABILITY: 0,
  REJOIN: 5,
